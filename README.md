## About Me
Iâ€™m a **SOC Analyst** with over two years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, specializing in **Security Operations Center (SOC)** operations. My true passion lies in **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, where I focus on uncovering actionable insights to stay ahead of cyber threats. This repository is dedicated **exclusively to CTI**, showcasing my work in threat intelligence gathering, analysis, and dissemination.

Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, constantly exploring new tools, techniques, and trends to enhance my expertise in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.

## Areas of Expertise
- **SOC Analyst**
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**: Skilled in dark web intelligence, threat actor profiling, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection.
- **Phishing Analysis**: Proficient in dissecting phishing campaigns, identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and mitigating targeted attacks.

## Currently Under Construction ðŸš§
This repository is a work in progress. 
Iâ€™m actively building out detailed CTI reports, scripts (e.g., Python for OSINT automation), and more. 
Stay tuned for updates as I refine this space into a hub for threat intelligence enthusiasts.
